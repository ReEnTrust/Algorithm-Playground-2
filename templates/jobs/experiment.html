            </div>
            <p>An e-recruitment system is a web-based tool that automates recruiting processes such as publishing
               job positions, receiving job applicants' CVs, applicants' pre-screening, ranking and selection among
               others. An e-recruitment system can be job seekers oriented or recruiters oriented or both.
               In the first case, an e-recruitment system recommends to the candidate a list of job positions that better
               fits his profile. In the second case, recruiters publish the specifications of available job positions
               and the candidates can apply. Existing e-recruitment systems use keywords or faceted searches 
               to provide better search results to 
               different categories of users (including recruiters, job seekers, organisations etc.).
            </p>
            <p> An e-recruitment system as a web-based tool is a merge of algorithms that automates the 
              different requirements of the system. These algorithms take specific inputs from different 
              categories of users to generate results. For instance, a recruiter can provide specific inputs 
              (such as the required experience and education level
              etc) to the algorithms to rank candidates for an advertised job position. 
              Likewise, a job seeker can provide specific inputs that fits his profile to the algorithms to get
               desirable job search results.
            </p>
            <p>Generally, e-recruitment systems use recommender, prediction, semantic matching and filtering 
              algorithms among others. For instance, semantic matching algorithms associate semnatically 
              equivalent concepts from the user's CV with the job descriptions, using a dictionary of synonyms. 
              Likewise, filtering algorithms use applicants' personality traits, captured through online forms 
              or predicted for applicants' classification or ranking. E-recruitment systems implement 
              automated candidate ranking based on a set of credible criteria, which are usually specified by job recruiters. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Though an e-recruitment system assist in making recruitment processes more efficient and seemingly less biased 
              through automation, its algorithms rely heavily on data created by humans, and consequently can have human
              biases carry over to decisions made by the algorithms. This experiment is aimed at having a deeper 
              understanding what algorithmic factors and features may affect users’ perceptions of trust in e-recruitment 
              algorithms.

            </div>
            <p>Algorithm playground provides customised versions of the architecture of e-recruitment algorithms and 
              presents various types of explanations (both technical and non-technical) on the 
              components of e-recruitment algorithms and how the algorithms work. The tool is to develop to 
              examine users’ perception of trust in e-recruitment algorithms and the impact such trust on their 
              attitudes toward the algorithms.
            </p>
            <p>The overall goal of the tool is aimed to help job seekers to look behind the scene, regarding how 
              job applicants may be shortlisted by e-recruitment algorithms. The general public are expected to be 
              more experienced as job seekers than as recruiters. By exposing them about how algorithms may take 
              various factors into consideration to decide how a fictional job applicant is (or not) fit to a given 
              job description, we hope to assess how the study participants perceive the role of algorithms in 
              filtering job applicants, and what would make them trust algorithms more.
            </p>
            <p>Algorithm playground makes you explore different aspects of e-recruitment algorithms. Once a user 
              launches a search for a job on the experiment platform (such as sales manager in London, full time 
              position), then, the implemented job search algorithms returns a list of jobs fitting the search 
              criteria, from the tool local database. Then, the user could choose a job and a fictional job
              applicant in order to see how a list of fictional job applicants may be rated, 
              according to a given candidate ranking algorithm. Some explanations are provided to help users make 
              sense of the results.
