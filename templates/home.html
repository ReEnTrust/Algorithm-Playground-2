            <p>An e-recruitment system is a web-based tool that automates recruiting processes such as publishing
               job positions, receiving job applicants' CVs, applicants' pre-screening, ranking and selection among
               others. Existing e-recruitment systems use keywords or faceted searches 
               to provide better search results to different categories of users (including recruiters, job seekers,
                hiring agency etc.).
            </p>
            <p> An e-recruitment system as a web-based tool is a merge of algorithms that automates the 
              different requirements of the system. These algorithms take specific inputs from different 
              categories of users to generate results. For instance, a recruiter can provide specific inputs 
              (such as the required experience and education level
              etc) to the algorithms to rank candidates for an advertised job position. 
            </p>
            <p>Generally, e-recruitment systems use several algorithms such as recommender, prediction, 
              semantic matching and filtering algorithms among others. For instance, filtering algorithms
              use applicants' personality traits to rank applicants for a job position. The inputs for a filtering
              algorithm are usually specified by recruiters.
            </p>
            <p>
              This experiment is aimed at investigating factors and features that may 
              affect usersâ€™ perceptions of trust in e-recruitment algorithms.
